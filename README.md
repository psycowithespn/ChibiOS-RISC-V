# ChibiOS-RISC-V

This is my toy implementation of ChibiOS on a RISC-V processor, the SiFive FE310.

The following was implemented and somewhat working:
- CLINT Interrupts
- Tickless using MTIMECMP
- GPIO
- UART

KarlK90 took over from here and has upstreamed GD32VF103 code to [ChibiOS-Contrib](https://github.com/ChibiOS/ChibiOS-Contrib).

I'm not planning on pursuing this any further.
